1. Follow planned missions
1. Function autonomously (at least for short periods)
1. Charging dock

Features/Technology:

1. Use multi-leg walking motive (rather than wheels or tracks)
1. ROS
1. ARDUPILOT Mission Planner (?)

Proposed Sensors:

1. Measure current of leg servo motors to detect obstacles
1. Use force sensors for leg contact with ground and touching objects
1. Ultrasonic range finder
1. Laser range finder
1. 360° LiDAR
1. Camera (RPi)
1. Camera (FPV)
1. GPS
1. Compass
1. Temperature (ambient)
1. Sound (ReSpeaker)

Proposed User Interface:

1. Push-buttons (maybe the switch-board or µKOB?)
1. Rotary encoder (maybe the switch-board or µKOB?)
1. IR Remote
1. Listen to RC receiver for manual control
1. Pluggable mini-display on each leg (to see monitoring info)
1. Serial debug on each leg
1. Buzzer
