The Pico SDK is used to build the operating code. Various Pico SDK Examples
provided guidance for using the Pico and some of the operations. Code used for
the HWControl operating software was rarely copied from any of the examples. If
any significant portion was copied it has been noted in the source file where
it was used. That being said, any code used from the SDK or the SDK Examples is:
