/**
 * @brief Serial Bus Servo group control.
 * @ingroup servo
 *
 * Controls a group of HiWonder Serial Bus servos.
 * The servos are for the rover and are as follows:
 *
 * LF_DIR                              RF_DIR
 * LF_DRIVE                            RF_DRIVE
 *
 *                BOGIE_PIVOT
 * LM_DRIVE                            RM_DRIVE
 *
 *
 * LR_DRIVE                            RR_DRIVE
 * LR_DIR                              RR_DIR
 *
 * LF_DIR   : Turns the Left-Front drive wheel from -120째 to 0 to +120째
 * LF_DRIVE : Drives the Left-Front drive wheel with a speed from -1000 to 0 to +1000
 * LM_DRIVE : Drives the Left-Middle drive wheel
 * LR_DRIVE : Drives the Left-Rear drive wheel
 * LR_DIR   : Turns the Left-Rear drive wheel
 * RF_DIR   : Turns the Right-Front drive wheel from -120째 to 0 to +120째
 * RF_DRIVE : Drives the Right-Front drive wheel with a speed from -1000 to 0 to +1000
 * RM_DRIVE : Drives the Right-Middle drive wheel
 * RR_DRIVE : Drives the Right-Rear drive wheel
 * RR_DIR   : Turns the Right-Rear drive wheel
 * BOGIE_PIVOT : Reads, and can drive, the bogie pivot arm angle
